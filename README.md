# Calculator
A very personal first project. Basically, a weird looking calculator.

Just some experimentation. Something that was just very random and fun to use. I used HTML, CSS and vanilla JS to build this very simple calculator. Not complete yet as well. It has four of the 
basic operations for a calculator: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Good interactive buttons and nice output display. I tried to replicate the design of the old calculators that we used in our childhood for our math problems. There is a math fact button which 
I have used to simply display a math fact whenever the button is pressed. 
There is another button called the Rate The Calculator. A popup shows up while pressing it and takes the rating of the user in the form of stars (0-5). that's about it. 

!!!!!! My first ever piece of code !!!!!!!!!
